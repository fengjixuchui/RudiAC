# RudiAC

A very rudimentary anti-cheat used for a circumstantial freelance project. Much of the behavior and functionality is circumstantial.
The project was to attach a client-sided anti-cheat to an old game private server which already had some third party proprietary security modules attached which leads to an anti-cheat with noticeable exceptions to odd behavior.
